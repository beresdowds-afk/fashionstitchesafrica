FYSORA FASHN (Fashion Stitches Africa) ("FSA", "the Platform") operates solely as a neutral technology intermediary that connects Organizations, Tailors, and Customers. By using this platform, you expressly acknowledge and agree to the following:

1. NO QUALITY GUARANTEE: FSA does not guarantee, warrant, or endorse the quality, accuracy, timeliness, or suitability of any services provided by Organizations or Tailors registered on the platform. All work is performed by independent third parties, not by FSA.

3. CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITY: Customers engage with Organizations and Tailors at their own risk. FSA is not a party to any agreement between Customers and service providers. Disputes arising from service quality, delivery timelines, or craftsmanship are between the Customer and the respective Organization/Tailor.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: To the maximum extent permitted by law, FSA shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from:
   (a) The quality or outcome of tailoring or fashion services;
   (b) Any dispute between Organizations, Tailors, and/or Customers;
   (c) Financial losses resulting from third-party actions or omissions;
   (d) Breach of any agreement between platform users.

5. DISPUTE RESOLUTION: While FSA provides dispute resolution tools as a courtesy, FSA acts only as a facilitator and does not adjudicate or bear responsibility for the outcome of any dispute.

6. INDEMNIFICATION: All users agree to indemnify and hold harmless FSA, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from their use of the platform or interactions with other users.
