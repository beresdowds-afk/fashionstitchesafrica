# FYSORA Commercialization & Subscription Implementation Prompt

## Centralized Commercial Authority
All subscriptions, transaction fees, escrow fees, commissions, organization plans, and premium memberships belong exclusively to **FYSORA FASHN**.

- iFYSORA and FYSORA Companion **must not** create separate payment structures.
- They may display subscription offers and initiate checkout flows but the entire payment processing, subscription management, and revenue collection occurs within FYSORA FASHN.

## Editable Pricing Governance Platform
Use the existing **super admin interface** within FYSORA FASHN to manage all commercial parameters:

- **Subscription Plans** – create, update, delete, set prices (with multiple currencies).
  - Types: Free, Professional, Business, Enterprise.
  - Features per plan (e.g., number of measurements, analytics, premium support).
- **Transaction Fees** – commission rates for marketplace transactions.
- **Escrow Fees** – percentage or fixed fee per escrow transaction.
- **Service Fees** – e.g., for measurement verification, dispute resolution.
- **Promotions/Discounts** – define coupon codes, temporary discounts, trial periods.
- **Currency Exchange Rates** – for multi-currency support (if using a central conversion engine).

All changes are audited (who changed what, when) and can be rolled back if needed.

## Subscription Lifecycle
1. **Plan Selection** – user selects a plan in any PWA, which calls the FYSORA FASHN subscription API.
2. **Checkout** – FYSORA FASHN generates a payment intent (using a gateway like Stripe/Paystack) and returns a client secret.
3. **Payment** – the PWA confirms the payment via the gateway; FYSORA FASHN listens for webhooks to update subscription status.
4. **Activation** – subscription status becomes active; permissions are updated in the user's token.
5. **Renewal** – automatic renewal is managed by the payment gateway; FYSORA FASHN receives webhook and updates expiry.
6. **Cancellation** – user can cancel (immediate or at end of period) via any PWA; cancellation request goes to FYSORA FASHN.

## Payment Processing
- Support multiple payment methods: credit/debit cards, bank transfers, mobile money, etc., via available integrated gateway(s).
- Securely store payment method tokens (PCI-compliant).
- Handle recurring billing (subscriptions) and one-time payments (orders, escrow deposits).
- Provide invoices/receipts (generated and stored in FYSORA FASHN).
- Support refunds (initiated through FYSORA FASHN dispute workflow).

## Revenue Distribution
- For marketplace transactions, FYSORA FASHN retains commission and distributes remaining funds to sellers/professionals.
- For subscription revenue, FYSORA FASHN collects all fees.
- Payouts to professionals/organizations are scheduled and executed by FYSORA FASHN (with proper KYC/verification).

## Plan Features & Permissions
Each subscription plan defines a set of feature flags that are enforced by all applications. For example:
- `max_measurements_per_month`
- `can_use_analytics`
- `can_create_organizations`
- `can_access_premium_tools`
- `api_rate_limit`

FYSORA FASHN provides an endpoint `/api/subscriptions/features` that returns the user's feature set; each PWA uses this to enable/disable UI elements.

## Multi-Currency & Localization
- Plans can have prices in multiple currencies (NGN, USD, EUR, etc.).
- Users see pricing in their preferred currency (based on IP or account settings).
- Conversion rates are updated regularly (manual or via a service).
- Transactions are settled in the currency of the plan; gateway handles conversion if needed.

## Admin Dashboard
Use existing super admin panel for FYSORA FASHN staff to:
- View all subscriptions and their statuses.
- Manually adjust subscription (grant/revoke, extend, refund).
- Create/edit pricing plans and fees.
- Monitor revenue metrics (MRR, ARR, churn).
- Export reports.

## Webhooks & Notifications
- Payment gateway webhooks are received by FYSORA FASHN.
- Internal webhooks notify iFYSORA/Companion about subscription changes (so they can update UI and access).
- Email/SMS notifications are sent to users for:
  - Successful payment
  - Renewal reminder
  - Payment failure
  - Plan upgrade/downgrade

## Error Handling & Graceful Degradation
- If payment fails, the subscription is not activated; the user receives a clear explanation.
- Retry logic for failed payments (exponential backoff) with notifications.
- If a subscription expires, access is restricted; users may have a grace period (configurable).

## Security & Compliance
- PCI DSS compliance for handling card data (use tokenization).
- Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for customer data.
- All financial actions are logged for audit.
- Sensitive configuration (API keys, webhook secrets) stored in environment variables or a secrets manager.
